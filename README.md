## Implementation of "NEON as a navigator of energy open innovation ecosystems"
This is an official source code for implementing NEON.

### Protocol structure
1) Data collection and preprocessing
2) Energy-specific topic detection
3) Energy open innovation network construction
4) Research collaboration opportunity identification

### Dataset
- data/entities_DeepWalk.pkl: the embedding vectors for nodes in Period 2.
- data/processed_data.csv: the processed data for topic-paper-organization-nation links.
- data/sample_papers.xlsx: the sample data collected from the Web of Science.
- data/topic_labels.xlsx: the labels and abbreviations of research topics.
